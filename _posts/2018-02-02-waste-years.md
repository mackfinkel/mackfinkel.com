Animal agriculture is increasingly industrial, as demonstrated by a decreasing amount of [small farms](http://www.countinganimals.com/do-you-know-someone-who-buys-meat-only-from-a-small-local-farm/), and a steady increase of the percentage of animals [on](http://mackfinkel.com/agriculture/statistics/animals/2017/12/04/hog-ag-industrial.html) [factory](http://mackfinkel.com/agriculture/statistics/animals/2017/12/11/beef-ag-industrial.html) [farms](http://mackfinkel.com/agriculture/statistics/animals/2017/12/14/dairy-ag-industrial.html).

Another way to measure the industrialization of animal agriculture is to chart the waste produced by industry facilities. Using data from the Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory ([TRI](https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program)) Program, I charted the past 30 years in animal agriculture waste. These estimates measure the amount of waste that has been released or treated at the facility where it was created. In animal agriculture, this often involves [spraying waste](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-carolina-hog-farms-accused-of-putrid-pollution/) or [depositing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGJ1YSfDXs) in a septic pit.

<div id="htmlwidget-54ea940e1f6774f45410" style="width:100%;height:500px;" class="highchart html-widget"></div>

Waste produced by industrial animal agriculture facilities has increased in the past 30 years. This trend has taken place despite the demand and consumption of meat having seen a reasonable [decline](http://www.countinganimals.com/meat-consumption-and-demand-both-in-decline/) during this time period. It is also noteworthy that while this chart represents over 450 companies, just 6 of them consistently create as much waste as the other several hundred.

I am going to look deeper into what happened with the 2008 data, because as of now I cannot find an explanation for this very strange blip, which may be too inconsistent to reflect genuine information. Similarly, since the change between 2015 and 2016 in steeper than the difference between any other two years, I do not believe that all Toxics Release data from industries in 2016 has been made available yet.

This increase in waste production and industrialization is concerning due to the industry practices of large-scale operations that [abuse](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2014/02/Iron_Maiden_022014.html) animals, [harm](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10599240701881482) workers, [threaten](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/opinion/who-factory-farming-meat-industry-.html) public health, [damage](http://mackfinkel.com/agriculture/statistics/animals/inequality/2017/12/19/waste-inequality.html) the health of poorer communities, and heavily [contribute](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM) to climate change. There is too much waste, and not enough waste management.

<p class="text-muted">Updated October 5, 2018 to measure nitrogenous livestock waste from farms and slaughterhouses. The relationship between income inequality and animal agriculture is further discussed in <a href="http://mackfinkel.com/agriculture/statistics/animals/inequality/2018/06/04/income-animal-waste.html">this post</a>. The R code used to process data and create charts is on <a href="https://github.com/mackfinkel/misc/tree/master/posts/waste_posts">GitHub</a>.</p>
