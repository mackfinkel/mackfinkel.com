The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has a [ton of data](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dca) regarding law-enforcement and incarceration. For a class research project, I am looking into examining data on the pre-incarceration incomes of incarcerated parents. For this topic, I am looking to examine three datasets: the [Survey of Inmates in Federal Correctional Facilities (SIFCF)](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=273), the [Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities (SISCF)](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=275), and the [Survey of Inmates in Local Jails (SILJ)](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=274). I will be downloading the most recent datasets from each, which includes [2004 data from the SIFCF and SISCF](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/studies/4572) as well as [2002 data from the SILJ](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/4359).

This data, for the most part, is formatted to be accessible in closed-source programs that I would need to purchase a license to use. There are two problems with that: federally funded data should not require the public to purchase software to access it, and I don't want to use that software. Here's how to circumvent that and import the data from ASCII + SAS format into R:

```
#download datasets
#jails: http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/4359
#prisons: http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/studies/4572
#I am not allowed to re-distribute this original dataset
#use "ASCII + SAS setup" links
#unzip and concatenate datasets to same two folders (jails: "ICPSR_04359", prisons: "ICPSR_04572")

#set dir to dir with both data folders
setwd("YOURDIRECTORYHERE")

#convert data to R, save in repsective folders
library(SAScii)
#SAScii package allows R to follow .sas input directions for .txt ASCII files, so long as the user specifies line in the .sas file at which "INPUT" starts manually
#Use a text editor to open .sas files and find "INPUT" lines
#define input lines
input04359_DS0001 <- 3681
input04359_DS0002 <- 50
input04572_DS0001 <- 3904
input04572_DS0002 <- 3898
input04572_DS0003 <- 424
input04572_DS0004 <- 424

#define lrcel, also manually from .sas files
lrcel04359_DS0001 <- 4679
lrcel04359_DS0002 <- 14326
lrcel04572_DS0001 <- 8845
lrcel04572_DS0002 <- 8845
lrcel04572_DS0003 <- 2580
lrcel04572_DS0004 <- 2580

#load data. takes a long time.
data04359_DS0001 <- read.SAScii("ICPSR_04359/DS0001/04359-0001-Data.txt", "ICPSR_04359/DS0001/04359-0001-Setup.sas", input04359_DS0001, lrecl = lrcel04359_DS0001)

data04572_DS0002 <- read.SAScii("ICPSR_04572/DS0002/04572-0002-Data.txt", "ICPSR_04572/DS0002/04572-0002-Setup.sas", input04572_DS0002, lrecl = lrcel04572_DS0002)

data04572_DS0004 <- read.SAScii("ICPSR_04572/DS0004/04572-0004-Data.txt", "ICPSR_04572/DS0004/04572-0004-Setup.sas", input04572_DS0004, lrecl = lrcel04572_DS0004)

#save in "data" folder
dir.create("data")
setwd("data/")
save(data04359_DS0001,file="data04359_DS0001.Rda")
save(data04359_DS0002,file="data04359_DS0002.Rda")
save(data04572_DS0001,file="data04572_DS0001.Rda")
save(data04572_DS0002,file="data04572_DS0002.Rda")
save(data04572_DS0003,file="data04572_DS0003.Rda")
save(data04572_DS0004,file="data04572_DS0004.Rda")
4572_DS0002$V1825)
```

And that's it. Analyze away.
